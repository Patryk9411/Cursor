# Cursor Projects

This repository collects small Cursor-powered experiments. Each project sits in
its own folder so you can open just the one you want (e.g., double-click a GUI
script or run it from the terminal).

## Projects

- [`tic_tac_toe/`](tic_tac_toe/) – Tic-Tac-Toe with both CLI and GUI launchers.

Clone and explore any subdirectory for details and usage instructions.
